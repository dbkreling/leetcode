# Fizz Buzz Enhanced

This problems is an implementation of an example solution that is faster than the original FizzBuzz problem.

It also contains an exercise implementation of a python function.

Apart from the [leetcode](https://leetcode.com/problems/fizz-buzz/solutions/1369285/python-3-beats-100-0-simple/) solution to the FizzBuzz problem, this directory contains references to Programiz [function](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/function) and [classes](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/class) sections.

The following is the description of the problem:


Given an integer n, return a string array answer (1-indexed) where:

answer[i] == "FizzBuzz" if i is divisible by 3 and 5.
answer[i] == "Fizz" if i is divisible by 3.
answer[i] == "Buzz" if i is divisible by 5.
answer[i] == i (as a string) if none of the above conditions are true.
 

## Example 1:
Input: n = 3
Output: ["1","2","Fizz"]

## Example 2:
Input: n = 5
Output: ["1","2","Fizz","4","Buzz"]

## Example 3:
Input: n = 15
Output: ["1","2","Fizz","4","Buzz","Fizz","7","8","Fizz","Buzz","11","Fizz","13","14","FizzBuzz"]
 

Constraints:

1 <= n <= 104
