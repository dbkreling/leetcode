Given an array of integers nums which is sorted in ascending order, and an integer target, 
write a function to search target in nums. If target exists, then return its index. Otherwise, return -1.

You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.

See this StackOverflow answer[0] for a quick refresh on o(log n) complexity.
