# Leetcode Exercises Practice
Leetcode / Hackerank problems

This project is a compilation of some algorithm exercises found at Leetcode.com.

For each exercise, there is a directory named with the title of the problem. Inside each of them there will be a **problem.txt** or **problem.md** file with the description of the problem.

Inside each **solution.py** you may find commented lines with different inputs, so you can try them out to see the solution's output.

You can browse the commit history for more information about the exercise, such as comments, notes and links that are relevant to the problem or solution.

The solutions have been implemented in **Python 3**, and can be run involking Python (e.g. `python solution.py)` by running them directly from the command line (e.g. `./solution.py`)
